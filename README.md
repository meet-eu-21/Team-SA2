# Usage
As generating the input windows through the data generator is highly time consuming, it is highly recommended to pregenerate the data. In order to do so, the "Data_preprocess.ipynb" jupyter notebook will guide you (Feel free to modify the data generator if you don't want to locally store the input data). At the moment, the input windows size is (33,33). This parameter can be change while generating the data but cannot be dynamically passed (feature to be developped).

The training is done with "run_cnn.py" file.
